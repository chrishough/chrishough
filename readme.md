### :book: 𝙰𝚋𝚘𝚞𝚝 𝙼𝚎

Founder and engineering leader passionate about building high-impact products, empowering remote teams, and integrating AI to push the boundaries of what’s possible. I build with Ruby, architect APIs, and engineer intelligent systems that amplify creativity, clarity, and execution.  
  
I lead with heart and operate with intention—engineering not just software, but environments where people grow and thrive. Whether I’m mentoring a team, shipping a product, or shaping new AI-driven workflows, I approach it all with craftsmanship and care.  
  
My philosophy is simple: optimize everything—your codebase, your body, your mindset. From chasing a Half Ironman to rebuilding myself from the inside out, I live by the belief that our greatest work starts within. I’m obsessed with growth, driven by purpose, and fueled by the thrill of crafting things that resonate, endure, and matter.  
  
The goal isn’t just to ship software—it’s to build experiences that make people feel, teams that perform with soul, and a life I never want to escape from.  
  
Let’s craft something that outlives us—together, and enjoy the thrill while we’re at it.
